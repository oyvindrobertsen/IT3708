\begin{abstract}

\noindent This report describes a solution to Project 4 in the subject IT3708 at NTNU. 
The purpose of this project is to use an evolutionary algorithm to tune the weights of a continuous time recurrent neural network, which then acts as an agent in a simple game in a 2D world and receives a performance score.

    \section{Implementation}
    A phenotype is the representation of the weights of a CTRNN.
    A CTRNN requires more weights than the simple ANN from project 3.
    In addition to matrices that represent arcs crossing between layers,
    there are also internal arcs between the neurons of a layer,
    and each neuron requires two additional paramenters, the \textit{gain} and \textit{time constant}.

    The genotype is a bitstring of size $8 * \text{number of weights}$.
    The conversion to phenotype takes each 8 bit sequence and interprets it as a floating point value between $0.0$ and $1.0$.
    These values are then fitted into matrices that represent the arc weights,
    or assigned as \texttt{g} or \texttt{t} values of neurons,
    and scaled and adjusted to an appropriate range.

    The CTRNN implementation is a modified version of the ANN implementation from project 3.
    Neurons are no longer only simple numerical values where input is equal to output,
    but are objects that maintain state and computes output based on input and state.

    At each tick of the simulation the input nodes get either $1$ or $0$ from the sensors.
    They then output some value computed with the input, the previous state, the \textit{gain} and \textit{time constant} parameters and the sigmoid function.
    These values are propagated along the weighted arcs to the next layer,
    where the sum of the inputs to each neuron goes through the same calculation.
    In the CTRNN there are also internal arcs in each non-input layer,
    including arcs from the neuron to itself.
    These are also part of the sum of inputs.

    Once the sensory inputs have propagated their way through the network and the final layer has new output values,
    the agent object uses these values to make a decision about how to act in the Beer Tracker World.
    If the left neuron has a higher value than the right neuron the agent will move left, and vice versa.
    The magnitude of the output decides the magnitude of the movement,
    so an output near $1.0$ means the agent takes 4 steps and an output near $0.0$ means it takes no steps at all.

    \section{Performance}
    It is more difficult to consistently reproduce the same behavior in this project than it has been in previous projects.
    This is because both the problem and the CTRNN itself are more complex,
    with more variable parameters and more randomness.

    In the standard scenario the most commonly seen evolved behavior is an agent which moves in only one direction.
    It stops and stands still to capture most objects,
    but is not very good at avoiding the dangerous objects,
    and often captures big objects too.
    We have however also seen smarter agents appear sometimes,
    that are able to avoid most dangerous objects,
    while also being able to capture most safe objects.
    These will typically slow down when they find an object,
    and do small steps to "figure" out the size of the object,
    then either stand still if it is safe or accelerate away if not.

    The agent in the "pull" scenario typically acts a lot like the standard agent,
    but uses the pull move instead of standing still and waiting for small objects to drop.
    Sometimes the time recurrency of the network makes it use the pull power two times.

    Listing \ref{points} shows how points are awarded.
    It is possible to capture an object, to avoid it, or to fail at either.
    These points are used as the fitness measure, which can be seen evolving in figure \ref{standard}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Awarding points which are used for fitness measure, label=points]
def capture(self, obj):
    if obj.width >= 5:
        self.points -= 2
    else:
        self.points += 1

def avoidance(self, obj):
    if obj.width >= 5:
        self.points += 2
    else:
        self.points -= 1

def fail(self, obj):
    self.points -= 2
    \end{lstlisting}

        \caption{}
        \label{standard}
    \end{figure}


    In the no-wrap scenario the most commonly seen behavior is for the agent to move to one of the corners and then just sitting there for the entirety of the simulation.
We managed to coax an agent into moving back and forth by increasing the range of the time constant drastically.
However this agent performed much worse than a standard agent at capturing and avoiding.
